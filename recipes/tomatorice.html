    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>wash the rice really well. Soak them in water for 1 hour.</p></li>
        <li>
            <p>Lets make the special biryani masala. measure all your ingredients and set aside. You can either roast the masala or grind it dry.</p>
            <p>I added all my dry masala in a blender and powder it fine. but i strongly suggest to dry roast it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Now lets marinate the chicken. Take chicken in a bowl, add in spice masala use kashmiri chilli powder, coriander powder and salt. Add in chopped coriander leaves and mint leaves. Pour in yogurt. Make sure you use un sour plain yogurt.</p>
            <p>Mix well and let this marinate overnight. I let this marinate for 2 to 3 hours.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Turn of the gas and add Ghee in a large pot, in which you are going to make biryani. Add Mint leaves, Spices to the hot ghee and saute, layer add onions and cook them till golden brown</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Add salt to taste, marinated meat goes in the pot, coot it for a minute or two.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Pour required amount of water based on the rice used (for 1 cup of rice add 2 cups of water). It would be better if you add warm water. Taste and add if salt or masala is required</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Once the water is boiling hot close the pot tightly and simmer it down for 20-25 mins.</p></li>
        <li>Serve the mouth watering Biriyani and enjoy it with ThumsUP.</li>
    </ol>
